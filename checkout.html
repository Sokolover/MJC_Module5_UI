                                    Amy normally hated Monday mornings, but this year was different. Kamal was in her
                                    art class and she liked Kamal. She was waiting outside the classroom when her friend
                                    Tara arrived.
                                    “Hi Amy! Your mum sent me a text. You forgot your inhaler. Why don’t you turn your
                                    phone on?” Amy didn’t like technology. She never sent text messages and she hated
                                    Facebook too.
                                    “Did Kamal ask you to the disco?” Tara was Amy’s best friend, and she wanted to know
                                    everything that was happening in Amy’s life. “I don’t think he likes me,” said Amy.
                                    “And I never see him alone. He’s always with Grant.” Amy and Tara didn’t like Grant.
